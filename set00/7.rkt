;; circumference : Number -> Number
;; GIVEN: the radius r of a circle 
;; RETURNS: its circumference, using the formula 2 * pi * r.
;; Examples:
;; (circumference 1)  =>  6.283185307179586 
;; (circumference 0)  =>  0

(define ( circumference x)
  (* 2 pi x))
( circumference 1);
;;Test:
(check-within (circumference 1) #i6.283185307179586 0.1) 
(check-expect (circumference 0)  0)
